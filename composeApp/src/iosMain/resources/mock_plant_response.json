              "value": "Buddleja davidii (spelling variant Buddleia davidii), also called summer lilac, butterfly-bush, or orange eye, is a species of flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae, native to Sichuan and Hubei provinces in central China, and also Japan. It is widely used as an ornamental plant, and many named varieties are in cultivation. The genus was named Buddleja after Reverend Adam Buddle, an English botanist. The species name davidii honors the French missionary and explorer in China, Father Armand David, who was the first European to report the shrub. It was found near Ichang by Dr Augustine Henry about 1887 and sent to St Petersburg.  Another botanist-missionary in China, Jean-André Soulié, sent seed to the French nursery Vilmorin, and B. davidii entered commerce in the 1890s.B. davidii was accorded the RHS Award of Merit (AM) in 1898, and the Award of Garden Merit (AGM) in 1941.",

It can tolerate a range of soil types, including sandy, loamy, and clay soils, as long as there is good drainage. Adding organic matter like compost can improve soil fertility and structure, helping the plant to establish and thrive.",
            "common_uses": "Common uses for this plant include ornamental landscaping and wildlife gardens. It is often used as a focal point in garden beds, borders, and as a hedge. Its ability to attract butterflies and bees makes it a valuable addition to pollinator gardens. Additionally, its cut flowers can be used in floral arrangements, adding a splash of color and fragrance to indoor spaces.",

It is often planted in butterfly gardens and is associated with themes of transformation and beauty. Its vibrant flowers and pleasant fragrance make it a popular choice in many gardens around the world.",
            "toxicity": "This plant is considered mildly toxic to both humans and animals if ingested. It can cause stomach upset and other gastrointestinal issues. While it is not highly toxic, it is best to keep it out of reach of pets and children to prevent accidental ingestion. Always wash hands after handling the plant to avoid any potential skin irritation.",
            "best_watering": "Watering this plant requires a balanced approach. It prefers well-drained soil and does not like to sit in water. Water it deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. During the growing season, typically spring and summer, it may need more frequent watering, especially in hot, dry conditions. In contrast, reduce watering in the fall and winter when the plant is not actively growing.",
